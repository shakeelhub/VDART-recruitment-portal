𝐂𝐫𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐭𝐬 & 𝐀𝐜𝐤𝐧𝐨𝐰𝐥𝐞𝐝𝐠𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬 🙌

Built by Sachin S and MD Shakeel S during a 3-month internship at VDart 🏢.
We wrestled 50k+ records 🗃️, tamed chaotic workflows 🐉, and automated tedious processes ⚙️ — all while navigating tight deadlines ⏳ and the occasional “it-worked-yesterday” bug 🐛.
The result? A system that turns days into minutes ⏱️, and hopefully earned us a spot in VDart’s automation hall of fame 🏆.
